4:T416,Share Purchase Agreements (SPAs) are critical legal documents governing equity transactions between parties. Whether raising investment, facilitating secondary sales, or structuring acquisitions, properly drafted SPAs protect all parties while ensuring smooth transaction completion.
 
 We draft detailed SPAs covering purchase price and payment terms, representations and warranties from both parties, closing conditions and covenants, indemnification and liability provisions, drag-along and tag-along rights, anti-dilution protection, and dispute resolution mechanisms. For investment rounds, we ensure investor protection clauses are balanced with founder interests.
 
 Our SPAs address complex scenarios including valuation mechanisms, escrow arrangements, earn-out provisions, and post-closing obligations. We ensure compliance with Companies Act, FEMA regulations (for foreign investment), and securities law requirements—creating legally sound agreements that facilitate successful equity transactions while protecting client interests.5:T416,Share Purchase Agreements (SPAs) are critical legal documents governing equity transactions between parties.
