d:T454,A Cofounders Agreement is the most critical document for any startup with multiple founders. It establishes clear expectations, prevents disputes, and provides mechanisms for resolving conflicts that inevitably arise during the entrepreneurial journey.
 
 We draft detailed founders' agreements covering equity ownership and vesting schedules, roles and responsibilities of each founder, decision-making authority and voting rights, intellectual property assignment, salary and compensation structures, founder exit procedures (voluntary and involuntary), dispute resolution mechanisms, and confidentiality obligations. We also address sensitive topics like founder departure, equity buyback terms, and non-compete clauses.
 
 Our agreements are customized to your specific startup dynamics, ensuring fair terms that protect all parties while maintaining team cohesion. We balance flexibility with clarity—creating documents that adapt to growth while providing certainty when disagreements occur. This upfront investment in proper documentation prevents costly disputes and protects your startup's future.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-20","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"","children":["Our ","Legal Drafting"," Services"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg opacity-75 max-w-2xl mx-auto","children":"Explore our comprehensive range of services tailored to your needs"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-12","children":[["$","div","cofounders-agreement",{"className":"group","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8 items-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"h-96 w-full lg:w-1/2","children":["$","$L3","legal-drafting",{"service":{"id":"cofounders-agreement","name":"Cofounders Agreement","shortDescription":"Draft comprehensive founders' agreements defining equity split, roles, responsibilities, vesting, and exit terms to prevent future disputes.","title":"Co-founders' Agreement Drafting","parentId":"legal-drafting","icon":"Handshake","longDescription":"$d","longHighlights":["Equity split and vesting schedule definition","Roles, responsibilities, and authority clarification","Intellectual property assignment and protection","Founder exit and buyback procedures","Dispute resolution mechanisms","Confidentiality and non-compete clauses","Customized to your startup's specific dynamics"],"highlights":["Equity split and vesting schedule definition","Roles, responsibilities, and authority clarification","Dispute resolution and exit mechanisms"],"metaDescription":"Prevent future disputes with a robust Cofounders Agreement.
