## Trademark Registration + Amazon Brand Registry Enablement

<SectionCard title="Client Profile">
  - **Business:** Ethnic women's wear - **Brand Name:** EthnicElegance -
  **Stage:** Planning Amazon launch - **Previous Experience:** ₹15L via
  Instagram & WhatsApp - **Objective:** Protected Amazon launch on Amazon
</SectionCard>

### The Challenge

Sanya had been successfully selling her ethnic wear designs through Instagram and WhatsApp for 18 months, generating ₹15 lakhs in revenue. Now she wanted to scale by launching on Amazon, but faced critical requirements:

<Highlight>
  Amazon Brand Registry requires a **registered trademark**, but trademark
  registration in India takes **18–24 months** — creating a growth vs protection
  dilemma.
</Highlight>

### Amazon Brand Registry Requirements:

- Amazon requires trademark registration (not just application) for Brand Registry
- Brand Registry essential for:
  - ASIN ownership and control
  - A+ Content (enhanced product pages)
  - Sponsored Brands advertising
  - Brand Analytics access
  - Protection against counterfeit sellers
  - Premium brand positioning

### The Dilemma:

- Trademark registration takes 18-24 months in India
- Can't access Brand Registry benefits without registered trademark
- Risk of starting without protection:
  - Other sellers could list under her brand name
  - No control over ASIN listings
  - Limited advertising options
  - Vulnerable to copycats once brand gains traction
- But waiting 2 years means losing market opportunity

### Competitive Pressure:

- Similar brands already established on Amazon
- Market getting crowded in ethnic wear category
- Needed to launch soon to capture market share
- But wanted to do it RIGHT with full protection

"I knew I had to get on Amazon to scale, but I also heard horror stories of brands getting hijacked by copycats. Friends told me to just start selling and worry about trademark later, but I wanted to build a real, protected brand from day one."

### Client Testimonial

<Testimonial
  quote="Everyone told me to just start selling and file trademark later. But Task360 explained that Amazon Brand Registry requires actual registration, not just application, and that takes 18 months. So we filed trademark on day one, launched on Amazon in month 2, and when our trademark came through in month 18, we immediately activated Brand Registry.

The transformation was incredible - A+ Content increased our conversions by 3%, Sponsored Brands campaigns became available, and most importantly, we built a brand that's fully protected. No copycat sellers, no brand hijacking, no confusion. Some competitors who launched without trademark are now dealing with copycats and can't even get Brand Registry.

That ₹1.25 lakh investment gave us a ₹50 lakh brand asset plus ₹45 lakhs in measurable annual returns. Best strategic decision we made."
