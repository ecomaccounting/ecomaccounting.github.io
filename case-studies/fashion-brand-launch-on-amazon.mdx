### Client Profile

## The Challenge

Priya and Divya had spent 8 months designing their clothing line and were ready to launch on Amazon. However, they faced multiple roadblocks:

- No formal business structure (operating as sole proprietors)
- Amazon required GST registration which needed a proper company
- Confused about whether to form PLC, LLP, or Partnership
- No clarity on which registrations were mandatory vs. optional
- Concerned about protecting their brand name legally
- Worried about compliance burden taking focus away from business

"We're designers, not lawyers or accountants. The legal maze was overwhelming and delaying our Amazon launch by months."

## Client Testimonial
<Testimonial quote=
"Task360 made incorporation feel effortless. They explained everything in plain language, handled all the paperwork, and kept us focused on launching our products. The founders agreement they insisted on seemed excessive at first, but when we started discussing Series A funding 18 months later, we realized how critical it was. Best investment we made."
