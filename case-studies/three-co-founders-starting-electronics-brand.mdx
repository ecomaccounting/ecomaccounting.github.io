### Client Profile
- **Business:** Smart home devices and accessories
- **Founders:** 3 professionals (engineering, marketing, operations backgrounds)
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue, just incorporated
- **Funding Plans:** Seed round within 12 months

### The Challenge

Amit (40% - CEO, product), Neha (35% - CMO, growth), and Vikram (25% - COO, operations) had incorporated their company and divided equity based on initial contribution and roles. However:

- No written founders agreement documenting the equity split
- No vesting schedule protecting the company if someone left early
- Unclear decision-making authority (especially on hiring and spending)
- No clarity on what happens if a founder wants to leave
- Investor friends warned that VCs would demand this documentation
- Growing tension about role clarity and equity fairness

<Highlight>
"We're childhood friends, but even friends need clear agreements. We almost had a major fallout over a hiring decision because roles weren't clear."
</Highlight>

## Our Solution

### Phase 1: Detailed Consultation & Alignment (Week 1)

Conducted separate and joint sessions with all three founders to understand:
- Individual expectations and concerns
- Long-term commitment and vision alignment
- Roles, responsibilities, and authority boundaries
- Exit scenarios and fallback positions
- Investor fundraising timeline and dilution concerns

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Founders Agreement (Week 2-3)

Drafted detailed agreement covering:

**Equity Structure & Vesting**
- Amit: 40% (1,60,000 shares)
- Neha: 35% (1,40,000 shares)
- Vikram: 25% (1,00,000 shares)
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- Monthly vesting thereafter (1/48th per month)

**Reverse Vesting Mechanism**
- All shares issued upfront subject to vesting
- Company right to buyback unvested shares at nominal value (₹10/share)
- Vesting accelerates 25% on Series A funding
- Double trigger acceleration on acquisition

**Roles & Responsibilities**
- Amit: CEO, product development, technology decisions, hiring (technical)
- Neha: CMO, marketing, brand, customer acquisition, hiring (marketing)
- Vikram: COO, operations, supply chain, vendor management, hiring (operations)
- Clear escalation matrix for disputes

**Decision-Making Framework**
- **Unanimous consent required:** Fundraising, large acquisitions, selling company, issuing new equity
- **Board majority:** Hiring C-level, budgets &gt;₹10L, vendor contracts &gt;₹5L
- **CEO authority:** Day-to-day operations, budgets &lt;₹10L
- **Functional authority:** Each founder has final say in their domain

**Exit & Termination Scenarios**

*Good Leaver (resignation after 1+ year, or termination without cause):*
- Vested shares retained
- Unvested shares bought back at fair market value
- 6-month vesting acceleration
- Right of first refusal on share sale to co-founders

*Bad Leaver (resignation before 1 year, termination for cause):*
- Vested shares bought back at lower of cost or FMV
- All unvested shares bought back at nominal value
- No acceleration

**Intellectual Property**
- All IP developed before and during company belongs to company
- Broad non-compete and non-solicitation (1 year post-exit)

### Phase 3: Supporting Documents (Week 3-4)

- Share Purchase Agreements for all three founders documenting initial purchase
- Reverse vesting deed and Articles of Association amendment
- Board resolutions approving all agreements
- IP assignment agreement from all three founders
- Updated cap table template for future rounds

## The Results

### Immediate Outcomes:
✅ Complete alignment on roles, equity, and decision-making  
✅ Legally enforceable protection for all parties  
✅ Investor-ready documentation before fundraising  
✅ Prevented potential co-founder conflict

### Business Impact (18 months later):
- Successfully closed ₹2.5Cr seed round from Venture Capitalist
- Investors specifically praised founder documentation
- One founder wanted to transition to advisor role (9 months in):
  - Process handled smoothly per agreement terms
  - Equity adjusted fairly (40% vested, buyback at FMV)
  - No legal disputes or bad blood
  - Hired replacement COO efficiently
- Company now valued at ₹18Cr post-money

### What Could Have Gone Wrong (Without Agreement):

❌ Departing founder could claim full 25% equity despite 9 months tenure  
❌ Legal battle over buyback price (nominal vs. fair market value)  
❌ Investors could have walked away due to unclear cap table  
❌ Company paralyzed by founder disputes on key decisions  
❌ Estimated cost: ₹15-25 lakhs in legal fees + 6-12 month delay + potential company failure

## Client Testimonial

<Testimonial quote=
"The founders agreement felt like overkill when we were just three friends excited about our idea. But when Vikram decided to pursue another opportunity 9 months in, that document saved our company. Everything was clear - how much equity he kept, the buyback price, the transition timeline. What could have been a nasty legal fight was handled in 3 weeks. Every startup needs this from day one."
