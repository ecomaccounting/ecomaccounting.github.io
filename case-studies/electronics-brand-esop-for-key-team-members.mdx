### Client Profile

- **Business:** Mobile accessories and smart devices
- **Platform:** Amazon (Brand Registry), Flipkart
- **Team Size:** 25 employees
- **Stage:** Series A funded, ₹12 Cr revenue
- **Challenge:** Retaining top talent in competitive market

## The Challenge

After raising Series A funding, Rohan's electronics brand was scaling rapidly. However, he faced a talent retention crisis:

## Attrition Problems:

- Lost Senior Marketing Manager to competitor (30% higher salary)
- Product Head got offer from established brand
- Operations Manager exploring opportunities
- Key team members felt "left out" of the wealth creation
- Couldn't match big brand salaries with cash alone
- Investors asking about talent retention strategy
  

  "We raised ₹5 crores, company valued at ₹25 crores. But my best people were
  leaving for 30% higher salaries. I couldn't afford to match everyone with
  cash, and I wanted them to feel like owners, not employees."


## Our Solution

### Phase 1: ESOP Strategy Design (Week 1-2)

**Initial Consultation:**

- Discussed retention goals and key talent
- Evaluated company's ability to dilute equity
- Reviewed investor restrictions (vesting schedule requirements)
- Analyzed tax implications for company and employees

**ESOP Pool Sizing:**

- Recommended: 10% ESOP pool (industry standard for Series A)
- Total shares: 10,00,000
- ESOP pool: 1,00,000 shares
- Authorized but unissued to avoid immediate dilution

**Eligibility & Grading:**

Created three tiers based on criticality:

**Grade A (Leadership Team - 5 people):**

- Product Head, Marketing Head, Operations Head, Tech Lead, Sales Head
- ESOP allocation: 40,000 shares total (8,000 each)
- Percentage: 0.8% each of current cap table

**Grade B (Senior Team - 10 people):**

- Senior managers, leads, specialists
- ESOP allocation: 40,000 shares total (4,000 each)
- Percentage: 0.4% each

**Grade C (High Performers - 10 people):**

- Mid-level employees with high potential
- ESOP allocation: 20,000 shares total (2,000 each)
- Percentage: 0.2% each

### Phase 2: ESOP Scheme Documentation (Week 3-4)

- 100% acceleration if role eliminated post-acquisition

**Legal Documentation:**

- Board resolution approving ESOP scheme

- ESOP trust deed (if applicable)
- Individual grant letters for each employee
- Exercise agreement template

### Phase 3: Valuation for Tax Compliance (Week 5)

**Conducted Rule 3(8) Valuation:**

- Engaged for formal valuation report
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method
- Fair Market Value determined: ₹250/share
- ESOP exercise price: ₹25/share
- Perquisite value: ₹225/share (on exercise)

**Tax Planning:**

- Advised employees on tax implications:
  - No tax at grant
  - Perquisite tax at exercise (₹225/share)
  - Capital gains tax at sale
- Suggested employees exercise in tranches to manage tax

### Phase 4: Implementation & Communication (Week 6-8)

**Employee Communication:**

_Town Hall Meeting:_

- Explained ESOP concept and wealth creation potential
- Illustrated scenarios:
  - "If company grows 5x in 5 years..."
  - "If we get acquired at ₹100 Cr..."
  - "Your ESOPs could be worth..."
- Addressed FAQs and concerns

_Individual Grant Letters:_

- Personalized letters to each recipient

**Client Testimonial**

<Testimonial
  quote="ESOPs transformed our company culture. People stopped thinking like employees and started acting like owners. Our Product Head, who was about to leave, told me 6 months later: 'Best decision I made was staying. I'm building my own wealth here.' Three years later, several team members are sitting on ₹50L+ in vested options. The loyalty this creates is priceless."
