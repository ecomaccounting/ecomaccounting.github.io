### Client Profile
- **Business:** Handcrafted home decor items
- **Founders:** Mother (55) and daughter (28)
- **Current Structure:** Partnership firm
- **Stage:** 2 years old, ₹1.2Cr revenue

## The Challenge

Sunita and her daughter Ananya had been running their home decor business successfully for 2 years as a partnership firm. They sold on Amazon, Flipkart, and their own website. Now they faced limitations:

- Partnership structure limiting growth potential
- Unable to raise funding (investors wanted Pvt Ltd structure)
- Personal liability concerns as business scaled
- High personal tax burden (no corporate tax benefits)
- Succession planning concerns (Sunita wanted clarity for family)

<Highlight>
"We started small, so partnership made sense. But now with ₹1.2 crore revenue and plans to raise ₹50 lakhs, banks and investors won't take us seriously."

## Client Testimonial

<Testimonial quote=
"We were nervous about the conversion - would we lose customers? Would Amazon delist us? Task360 managed everything so smoothly that not a single order was affected. The best part? Three months later, we closed our first investor round. The CA who did due diligence said our clean structure made the process 10x easier. That ₹1 lakh we spent on conversion probably saved ₹5-6 lakhs in fundraising hassles."
