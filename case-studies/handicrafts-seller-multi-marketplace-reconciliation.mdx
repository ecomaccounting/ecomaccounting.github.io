title: Handicrafts Seller - Multi-Marketplace Reconciliation
description: Monthly Accounting + GST + Marketplace Management
---

### Client Profile

- **Business:** Handmade handicrafts and artifacts
- **Platforms:** Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, own website
- **Stage:** 2 years old, ₹3 Cr revenue
- **Challenge:** Accounting chaos across multiple platforms

## The Challenge

Karthik's handicrafts business was thriving with sales across four channels. However, his accounting was a nightmare:

### Multiple Platform Complexities:

- Different commission structures: Amazon (15%), Flipkart (12%), Meesho (10%)
- Different settlement cycles: Amazon (7 days), Flipkart (15 days), Meesho (10 days)
- TCS deductions varying by platform
- Returns and refunds happening across all platforms
- Promotional charges deducted randomly
- No unified view of profitability per platform

### Accounting Mess:

- Recording only final settlement amounts (not gross sales)
- GST returns showed different numbers than bank statements
- No tracking of marketplace commissions, shipping fees, promotional charges
- Returns and refunds not properly accounted
- TCS deducted by platforms not claimed in ITR
- Couldn't answer: "Which platform is most profitable?"
- Annual turnover showing ₹1.8 Cr but actual sales were ₹3 Cr

    "My CA asked for sales data. I gave him bank statements. He said that's
    settlement, not sales. I was completely confused about my own business
    numbers!"

## Client Testimonial

<Testimonial
  quote="For 2 years, I was flying blind. I knew I was selling ₹25 lakhs per month, but had no idea if I was making money. Task360's platform-wise reconciliation was eye-opening - I was losing money on Amazon promotions while my own website was printing cash! Now I make decisions based on data, not gut feel. Revenue up 40%, profit up 55%."
