description: GST Registration + FSSAI + Multi-State Compliance
---

### Client Profile
- **Business:** Organic snacks and healthy foods
- **Founder:** Former corporate professional turned entrepreneur
- **Stage:** 6 months old, registered in Karnataka
- **Challenge:** Expanding to sell in 5+ states

## The Challenge

Rajesh had successfully built a local customer base selling organic snacks through his website and local stores in Bangalore. When he listed on Amazon and Flipkart, orders started coming from all over India. However:

- Only had GST registration in Karnataka (principal place of business)
- Tax liability exceeding ₹20 lakhs in Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu
- Required additional GST registrations in these states
- FSSAI license was state-specific, needed central license
- Receiving notices for non-registration in multiple states
- Managing compliance across states was becoming a nightmare

"I got my first GST notice from Maharashtra for ₹3.2 lakhs. I didn't even know I needed to register there separately!"

## Our Solution

### Immediate Crisis Management (Week 1)
- Analyzed sales data across all states for past 6 months
- Identified states where turnover exceeded ₹20 lakhs threshold:
  - Maharashtra: ₹28 lakhs
  - Delhi: ₹24 lakhs
  - Tamil Nadu: ₹22 lakhs
- Filed for GST registration in all 3 states on urgent basis
- Prepared detailed reply to Maharashtra GST notice explaining:
  - Genuine oversight (not willful default)
  - Immediate registration action taken
  - Voluntary disclosure of other states

### Compliance Restructuring (Week 2-4)
- Upgraded FSSAI State License to Central License (mandatory for multi-state sellers)
- Set up proper accounting systems to track state-wise sales
- Implemented monthly state-wise GST review process
- Registered for additional states as precautionary measure:
  - Uttar Pradesh (sales growing rapidly)
  - Gujarat (approaching threshold)

### Ongoing Compliance Management
- Monthly GST return filing across 6 states
- State-wise sales monitoring with threshold alerts
- E-way bill management for interstate supplies
- Annual GST reconciliation across all states

## The Results

### Immediate Outcomes:
✅ All state GST registrations obtained within 30 days  
✅ Central FSSAI license obtained  
✅ Zero further compliance notices  

### Business Impact:
- Confidently expanded to all-India operations
- Revenue grew from ₹8 lakhs/month to ₹28 lakhs/month
- Saved estimated ₹8+ lakhs in potential penalties
- Can now focus on marketing instead of compliance fires

### Financial Impact:
- **Before:** Facing ₹3.2L demand + potential ₹5L+ in other states
- **After:** Settled for ₹45K + fully compliant across India
- **Savings:** ₹7.5+ lakhs in penalties avoided
