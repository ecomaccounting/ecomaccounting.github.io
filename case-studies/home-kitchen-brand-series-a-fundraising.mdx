### Client Profile
- **Business:** Premium home & kitchen products
- **Brand:** "LuxeHome"
- **Stage:** 4 years old, ₹18 Cr revenue, profitable
- **Team:** 45 employees
- **Objective:** Raise ₹8-10 Cr for pan-India expansion

## The Challenge

Rahul and Nisha had bootstrapped LuxeHome to ₹18 Cr revenue with healthy margins. Now they needed capital to scale:

### Growth Opportunity:
- Strong brand recognition in North India
- Expansion to South and West markets needed
- Wanted to launch in 500+ retail stores
- Build brand-owned D2C website (currently 80% marketplace)
- Inventory investment required: ₹3 Cr
- Working capital for expansion: ₹2 Cr
- Marketing and brand building: ₹3 Cr

### Fundraising Inexperience:
- Never raised external capital before
- No idea how to value the company
- Didn't know what investors would scrutinize
- Pitch deck was product catalog, not investment opportunity
- No financial model beyond basic projections
- Unsure: How much equity to give? What terms to accept?
<Highlight>
"We knew we needed ₹8-10 crores to scale, but had zero experience with investors. Friends said we'd need to give up 30-40% equity. We didn't know if that was fair or how to negotiate."

## Client Testimonial
<Testimonial quote=
"We thought ₹10 lakh for fundraising advisory was expensive. But they helped us raise ₹10 crores at ₹50 Cr valuation with only 16.7% dilution. Friends who raised around the same time gave up 35-40% equity. That difference is worth ₹12 crores at our current ₹185 Cr valuation. The investor-ready data room they created also helped us close Series B in just 2 months. Best investment we ever made."
