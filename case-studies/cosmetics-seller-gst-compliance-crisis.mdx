description: GST Litigation Support + Compliance Restructuring
---

**Client Profile**
- **Business:** Skincare and cosmetics products
- **Platform:** Amazon, Nykaa, Flipkart
- **Stage:** 3 years old, ₹5 Cr annual revenue
- **Crisis:** Multiple GST notices and demands

## The Challenge

Meera had built a successful cosmetics brand with healthy sales across major platforms. However, her bookkeeping was informal and GST compliance was inconsistent:

### Problems Accumulated:**
- ₹18 lakhs GST demand notice for:
  - Wrong HSN code classification (₹8L demand)
  - Input tax credit (ITC) mismatches (₹6L demand)
  - Late filing penalties & Interesr (₹4L demand)
- GSTR-2A vs. GSTR-3B reconciliation never done
- Claimed ITC on personal expenses (car, phone)
- Missing purchase invoices from local vendors
- E-way bills generated incorrectly for interstate sales
- GST returns filed late regularly (3-6 months delay)
- Now received summons for personal hearing
<Highlight>
"I was so focused on growing sales that I ignored GST compliance. My previous accountant just filed returns without checking anything. Now I'm facing ₹18 lakhs demand and potential prosecution."
</Highlight>
## Our Solution

### Phase 1: Immediate Crisis Management (Week 1-2)

**Assessment & Documentation:**
- Conducted full GST audit for 3 years
- Reconciled all sales invoices with GSTR-1 filings
- Matched all purchase invoices with GSTR-2A
- Identified actual vs. claimed discrepancies
- Analyzed HSN code misclassification impact

**Findings:**
- **HSN Code Issue:** Not entirely wrong, just more specific code available
  - Actual tax difference: ₹1.2L (not ₹8L as claimed)
- **ITC Mismatch:** Primarily due to vendor non-filing
  - Legitimate ITC: ₹3.8L (out of ₹6L disallowed)
  - Ineligible ITC: ₹2.2L (personal use, missing docs)
- **Late Filing:** Penalty valid

### Phase 2: Legal Response & Representation (Week 3-6)

**Prepared Comprehensive Reply:**

*HSN Code Classification:*
- Cited relevant GST circulars and case laws
- Demonstrated both codes applicable under product description
- Argued tax rate same in both classifications
- Actual short payment: Only ₹1.2L (recalculated)

*ITC Reconciliation:*
- Submitted GSTR-2A vs. claimed ITC reconciliation
- Provided vendor details and follow-up proof:
  - ₹2.8L: Vendors filed GSTR-1 late (after our GSTR-3B)
  - ₹1.0L: Vendor GST numbers genuine, returns filed subsequently
  - ₹2.2L: Voluntarily reversed ineligible ITC

**Personal Hearing Representation:**
- Attended personal hearing with complete documentation
- Presented reconciliation evidence systematically
- Demonstrated good faith efforts to comply
- Submitted revised computation with voluntary payment

### Phase 3: Compliance Restructuring (Ongoing)

**Implemented Robust GST Systems:**

*Monthly Compliance Checklist:*

- GSTR-1 filed by 10th of next month
- GSTR-2A vs. GSTR-2B reviewed for ITC

## Client Testimonial
<Testimonial quote=
"That GST notice was the most stressful period of my business. I couldn't sleep for weeks. Task360 not only reduced my ₹18L demand to ₹2.25L, but they fixed my entire GST system. Now I actually understand what's happening with my taxes, and I haven't received a single notice in 18 months. The peace of mind is worth every rupee."
