### Client Profile

- **Business:** Home & Kitchen products
- **Platform:** Amazon, Flipkart, own D2C website
- **Stage:** 3 years old, ₹8 Cr revenue, 15 employees
- **Challenge:** Chaotic finances preventing next-level growth

## The Challenge

Arjun's business was doing well in revenue terms, but he had no financial clarity:

## Financial Chaos:

- No real-time P&L visibility (waited months for annual statements)
- Couldn't answer: "Are we profitable?" (beyond bank balance check)
- Cash flow surprises (unexpected shortfalls despite good sales)
- No budgeting or forecasting
- Pricing based on gut feel, not data
- Inventory planning reactive (stockouts or excess)
- Couldn't evaluate: Should I hire? Invest in marketing? Expand warehouse?

### Growth Blockers:

- Angel investors interested but wanted 3-year projections (didn't have)
- Bank loan application rejected (poor financial documentation)
- Couldn't negotiate with vendors (no cost structure clarity)
- Wasting money on inefficient marketing (no attribution tracking)

<Highlight>
  "I was making ₹8 crores in revenue but had no idea if I was actually making
  money. When investors asked for financial projections, I had nothing to show.
  My accountant gave me balance sheet once a year - useless for daily
  decisions."
